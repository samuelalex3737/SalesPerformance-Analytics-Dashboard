# Executive Sales Performance & Customer Insights Dashboard

## 1) Project Overview
This project delivers an executive-level BI dashboard in **Streamlit** to track and diagnose:
- **Sales growth & seasonality**
- **Customer behavior & retention**
- **Profitability & margin performance**
- **Regional performance & category/product contribution**
- **Operational risks** (returns + discounting impact)

The dashboard is designed for **decision-grade insights** (not “pretty charts”), including KPI deltas versus a comparable prior period, diagnostic scatterplots, repeat behavior tracking, and an auto-generated insights panel.
